Fahrenheit and centigrade are two temperature scales in use today. The <B>Fahrenheit</B> scale was developed by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686 - 1736). In the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. The <B>centigrade</B> scale, which is also called the <B>Celsius</B> scale, was developed by Swedish astronomer Andres Celsius (1701 - 1744). In the centigrade scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees. The centigrade to Fahrenheit conversion formula is:

<I>C</I> = (5/9) * (<I>F</I> - 32)

where <I>F</I> is the Fahrenheit temperature. You can also use this Web page to convert Fahrenheit temperatures to centigrade. Just enter a Fahrenheit temperature in the text box below, then click on the Convert button.
